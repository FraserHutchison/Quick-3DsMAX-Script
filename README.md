"Feel free to contact me about any issues, however I may not always be able to solve them.
If you want to try and fix any issues feel free."

NOTE: "This is a compiled version, the original version is split into many separate scripts to make it easier for development and makes use of the *include* construct. I tried to make a .mzp version however it has proven to be a real pain and for now I have not bothered as the compiled one works just fine. PLEASE READ the .ReadMe in the uncompiled scripts if you are going to use them"
