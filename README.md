[BUGS]
1. BatchImport = If you opne BatchImport then close it, you will get an error and the MaxScript Editor will appear
--Solution for now: close the MaxScript Editor and also CustomTools, then you are free to open it again using your cutsom shortcut.

2.Smart Stitch = Sometimes the smart sticth doesnt work the best, I am unsure why. For the most part is works fine.
--Solution: N/A for now

3.How to move UI = Not so much a bug but to move the UI you have to click the small gap next to the 3DS MAX button. Im gonna try and fix this in another update.
--Solution: N/A for now
